A common tool in Minetest are, of course, mining tools. These are important to break all kinds of blocks. Weapons are a kind of tool in Minetest. There are of course many other possible tools. Special actions of tools are usually done by left-click or right-click. =
A community-based documentation website for Minetest. Anyone with an account can edit it! It also features a documentation of Minetest Game. =
A core feature of Minetest is the built-in modding capability. Mods modify existing gameplay. They can be as simple as adding a few decorational blocks or be very complex by e.g. introducing completely new gameplay concepts, generating a completely different kind of world, and many other things. =
A description on how to craft an item is called a “crafting recipe”. You need this knowledge to craft. There are multiple ways to learn crafting recipes. One way is by using a crafting guide, which contains a list of available crafting recipes. Some games provide crafting guides. There are also some mods which you can download online for installing a crafting guide. Another way is by reading the online manual of the game (if one is available). =
A dropped item stack can be collected by punching it. =
A few things can not be pointed. Most blocks are pointable. A few blocks, like air, can never be pointed. Other blocks, like liquids can only be pointed by special items. =
A generic Internet Relay Chat channel for everything related to Minetest where people can meet to discuss in real-time. If you do not understand IRC, see the Community Wiki for help. =
A weapon only deals full damage when it has fully recovered from a previous punch. Otherwise, the weapon will deal only reduced damage. This means, quick punching is very fast, but also deals rather low damage. Note the full punch interval does not limit how fast you can attack. =
A web-based discussion platform where you can discuss everything related to Minetest. This is also a place where player-made mods and games are published and discussed. The discussions are mainly in English, but there is also space for discussion in other languages. =
Advanced information about Minetest which may be nice to know, but is not crucial to gameplay =
Advanced usage =
After mining, a block may leave a “drop” behind. This is a number of items you get after mining. Most commonly, you will get the block itself. There are other possibilities for a drop which depends on the block type. The following drops are possible: =
All liquids share the following properties: =
Almost all blocks can be built (or placed). Building is very simple and has no delay. =
An item stack is a collection of items of the same type which fits into a single item slot. Item stacks can be dropped on the ground. Items which drop into the same coordinates will form an item stack. =
Artificial light is emitted by luminous blocks. Artificial light has a light level from 1-14. =
Artificial light will lose one level of brightness for each transparent or semi-transparent block it passes through, until only darkness remains (image 1). =
As the world is entirely block-based, so is the light in the world. Each block has its own brightness. The brightness of a block is expressed in a “light level” which ranges from 0 (total darkness) to 15 (as bright as the sun). =
At a health of 0, the player dies. The player can just respawn in the world. =
At the bottom of the screen you see some squares. This is called the “hotbar”. The hotbar allows you to quickly access the first items from your player inventory. =
Basic movement: =
Basics =
Blocks =
Blocks can almost always be built at pointable blocks. One exception are blocks attached to the floor; these can only be built on the floor. =
Blocks can also have their own inventory, e.g. chests and furnaces. =
Blocks can have a wide range of different properties which determine mining times, behavior, looks, shape, and much more. Their properties include: =
Blocks have 3 levels of transparency: =
Blocks require a mining tool to be mined. Different blocks are mined by different mining tools, and some blocks can not be mined by any tool. Blocks vary in toughness and tools vary in strength. Mining tools will wear off over time. The mining time and the tool wear depend on the block and the mining tool. The fastest way to find out how efficient your mining tools are is by just trying them out on various blocks. Any items you gather by mining go straight into your inventory. =
Blocks: =

By holding down [Z], you can zoom the view at your crosshair. You need the “zoom” privilege to do this. =

Commands are followed by zero or more parameters. =
Commands may or may not give a response in the chat log, but errors will generally be shown in the chat. Try it for yourselves: Close this window and type in the “/mods” command. This will give you the list of available mods on this server. =

Cooking =
Cooking (or smelting) is a form of crafting which does not involve a crafting grid. Cooking is done with a special block (like a furnace), an cookable item, a fuel item and time in order to yield a new item. =
Coordinates =
Crafting =
Crafting is the task of combining several items to form a new item. =
Crafting recipes consist of at least one input item and exactly one stack of output items. When performing a single craft, it will consume exactly one item from each stack of the crafting grid, unless the crafting recipe defines replacements. =
Damage can be disabled on any world. Without damage, players are immortal and health and breath are unimportant. =
Detailed explanation: =
Each cookable item requires time to be cooked. This time is specific to the item type and the item must be “on fire” for the whole cooking time to actually yield the result. =
Each fuel item has a burning time. This is the time a single item of the fuel keeps a furnace burning. =
Each player has a set of privileges, which differs from server to server. Your privileges determine what you can and can't do. Privileges can be granted and revoked from other players by any player who has the privilege called “privs”. =
Everything you need to know about Minetest to get started with playing =
Example: A block with the mining property “cracky”, rating 3 and toughness level 0 can only be broken by a tool which is able to break “cracky” blocks at rating 3 and it must have a toughness level of 0 or larger. =
Exchanging: You can exchange items if the cursor holds 1 or more items and the destination slot is occupied by a different item type. =
Extended movement (requires privileges): =
Fast mode: =
Flowing liquids take a sloped form. Flowing liquids spread around the world until they drain. A flowing liquid can not sustain itself and always comes from a liquid source, either directly or indirectly. Without a liquid source, a flowing liquid will eventually drain out and disappear. =
Fly mode: =
For a full list of all available settings, use the “Advanced settings” dialog in the main menu. =

Here are a few basic privilege-related commands: =
Here are some examples to illustrate the command syntax: =
Hotbar =
If you have the required privileges, you can use up to three special movement modes. Using these may be considered cheating. =
If you jump while holding the sneak key, you also jump slightly higher than usual. =
In multi-player mode, the name of other players is written above their head. =
In order to mine a block, these conditions need to be met: =
In single-player mode, you can use “/grant singleplayer all” to unlock all abilities (which is often considered cheating). =
In some crafting recipes, some input items do not need to be a concrete item, instead they need to be a member of a group (see “Basics > Groups”). These recipes offer a bit more freedom in the input items. Images 6-8 show the same group-based recipe. Here, 8 items of the “stone” group are required, which is true for all of the shown items. =
In some games, the minimap may be disabled. =
In the command reference, you see some placeholders which you need to replace with an actual value. Here's an explanation: =
In the item help, many important groups are usually mentioned and explained. =
Interface =
Interface: =
Inventories are used to store item stacks. There are other uses, such as crafting. An inventory consists of a rectangular grid of item slots. Each item slot can either be empty or hold one item stack. Item stacks can be moved freely between most slots. =
Inventory controls: =
Inventory interaction: =
Items =
Items are things you can carry along and store in inventories. They can be used for crafting, smelting, building, mining, and more. Types of items include blocks, tools, weapons and items only used for crafting. =
Items, players and objects (animate and inanimate) can be members of any number of groups. Groups serve multiple purposes: =
Items: =
Just type in the message and hit [Enter]. Public chat messages can not begin with “/”. =
Light =
Like this: (5, 45, -12) =
Liquid sources have the shape of a full cube. A liquid source will generate flowing liquids around it from time to time, and, if the liquid is renewable, it also generates liquid sources. A liquid source can sustain itself. As long it is left alone, a liquid source will normally keep its place and does not drain out. =
Liquids =
Liquids are often not pointable. But some special items are able to point all liquids. =
Liquids are special dynamic blocks. Liquids like to spread and flow to their surrounding blocks. Players can swim and drown in them. =
Liquids usually come in two forms: In source form (S) and in flowing form (F). =
Many tools will wear off when using them and may eventually get destroyed. The damage is displayed in a damage bar below the tool icon. If no damage bar is shown, the tool is in mint condition. Tools may be repairable by crafting, see “Basics > Crafting”. =
Melee weapons deal damage by punching players and other animate objects. There are two ways to attack: =
Mineable blocks have mining properties (based on groups) and a toughness level. Mining tools have the same properties. Each mining property of a block also has a rating, while tools can be able to break blocks within a range of ratings. =
Minetest =
Minetest as well as Minetest Game are both unfinished at the moment, so please forgive us when not everything works out perfectly. =
Minetest can be played alone or online together with multiple players. Online play will work out of the box with any mods, with no need for additional software as they are entirely provided by the server. =
Minetest is a free software game engine for games based on voxel gameplay, inspired by InfiniMiner, Minecraft, and the like. Minetest was originally created by Perttu Ahola (alias “celeron55”). =
Minetest is usually bundled with a simple default game, named “Minetest Game” (shown in images 1 and 2). You probably already have it. Other games for Minetest can be downloaded from the official Minetest forums <https://forum.minetest.net/viewforum.php?f\=48>. =
Minimap =
Mining =
Mining (or digging) is the process of breaking blocks to remove them. To mine a block, point it and hold down the left mouse button until it breaks. =
Mining usually wears off tools. Each time you mine a block, your tool takes some damage until it is destroyed eventually. The wear per mined block is determined by the difference between the tool's toughness level and the block's toughness level. The higher the difference, the lower the wear. This means: =
Movement modes =
Noclip mode: =
Normally, blocks are built in front of the pointed side of the pointed block. A few blocks are different: When you try to build at them, they are replaced. =
Note that “transparency” here only means that the block is able to carry brightness from its neighboring blocks. It is possible for a block to be transparent to light but you can't see trough the other side. =
Official homepage of Minetest: <http://minetest.net/> =
On a multiplayer server with the default configuration, new players start with the privileges called “interact” and “shout”. The “interact” privilege is required for the most basic gameplay actions such as building, mining, using, etc. The “shout” privilege allows to chat. =
Online help =
Online multiplayer: =
Other consequences of death depend on the game. The player could lose all items, or lose the round in a competitive game. =
Players =
Players (actually: “player characters”) are the characters which users control. =
Players are capable of walking, sneaking, jumping, climbing, swimming, diving, mining, building, fighting and using tools and blocks. =
Players are living beings which occupy a space of about 1×2×1 cubes. They start with 20 health points (HP) and 10 breath points (BP). =
Players with the “privs” privilege can modify privileges at will: =
Pointing =
Press [F9] to make a minimap appear on the top right. The minimap helps you to find your way around the world. Press it again to select different minimap modes and zoom levels. The minimap also shows the positions of other players. =
Privileges =
Putting: You can put items onto a slot if the cursor holds 1 or more items and the slot is either empty or contains an item stack of the same item type. =
Quick start =
Quick transfer: You can quickly transfer an item stack to/from the player inventory to/from another item's inventory slot like a furnace, chest, or any other item with an inventory slot when that item's inventory is accessed. The target inventory is generally the most relevant inventory in this context. =
Radar mode (image 2) is more complicated. It displays the “denseness” of the area around you and changes with your height. Roughly, the more green an area is, the less “dense” it is. Black areas have many blocks. Use the radar to find caverns, hidden areas, walls and more. The rectangular shapes in image 2 clearly expose the position of a dungeon. =
Rarely, crafting recipes have replacements. This means, whenever you perform a craft, some items in the crafting grid will not be consumed, but instead will be replaced by another item. =
See the entry “Basics > Inventory”. =
Server commands =
Server commands (also called “chat commands”) are little helpers for advanced users. You don't need to use these commands when playing. But they might come in handy to perform some more technical tasks. Server commands work both in multi-player and single-player mode. =
Server commands can be entered by players using the chat to perform a special server action. There are a few commands which can be issued by everyone, but some commands only work if you have certain privileges granted on the server. There is a small set of basic commands which are always available, other commands can be added by mods. =
Server interaction: =
Settings =
Short explanation: =
Sneaking =
Sneaking makes you walk slower and prevents you from falling off the edge of a block. =
Sneaking might be disabled by mods. In this case, you still walk slower by sneaking, but you will no longer be stopped at ledges. =
Sneaking only works when you stand on solid ground, are not in a liquid and don't climb. =
Some blocks reduce breath. While being with the head in a block which causes drowning, the breath points are reduced by 1 for every 2 seconds. When all breath is gone, the player starts to suffer drowning damage. Breath is quickly restored in any other block. =
Some final remarks: =
Some items are usable as a melee weapon when wielded. Weapons share most of the properties of tools. =
Some items may serve as a tool when wielded. Any item which has some special use which can be directly used by its wielder is considered a tool. =
Sunlight is the brightest light and always goes perfectly straight down from the sky at each time of the day. At night, the sunlight will become moonlight instead, which still provides a small amount of light. The light level of sunlight is 15. =
Sunlight will preserve its brightness as long it only passes fully transparent blocks. When it passes through a semi-transparent block, it turns to artificial light. Image 2 shows the difference. =
Surface mode (image 1) is a top-down view of the world, roughly resembling the colors of the blocks this world is made of. It only shows the topmost blocks, everything below is hidden, like a satellite photo. Surface mode is useful if you got lost. =
Swimming in a liquid is fairly straightforward: The usual direction keys for basic movement, the jump key for rising and the sneak key for sinking. =
Taking: You can take items from an occupied slot if the cursor holds nothing. =
Technical terms: =
Technical: =
The Minetest world is a large cube. And because of this, a position in the world can be easily expressed with Cartesian coordinates. That is, for each position in the world, there are 3 values X, Y and Z. =
The drop goes directly into your inventory, unless there's no more space left. In that case, the items literally drop on the floor. =
The item help shows the mining times of a tool listed by its mining properties and its ratings. The mining times are often expressed as a range. The low number stands for the mining time for toughness level 0 and the high number for the highest level the tool can mine. =
The main place to find the most recent version of Minetest. =
The physics for swimming and diving in a liquid are: =
The player is thrown into a huge world made out of cubes or blocks. These cubes usually make the landscape they blocks can be removed and placed almost entirely freely. Using the collected items, new tools and other items can be crafted. Games in Minetest can, however, be much more complex than this. =
The selected item is also your wielded item. =
The time it takes to mine a block depends on the ratings and the toughness levels of both tool and block. =
The values for X, Y and Z work like this: =
The world of Minetest is made entirely out of blocks (voxels, to be precise). Blocks can be added or removed with the correct tools. =
There are 2 minimap modes and 3 zoom levels. =
There are also two different rotation modes. In “square mode”, the rotation of the minimap is fixed. If you press [Shift]+[F9] to switch to “circle mode”, the minimap will instead rotate with your looking direction, so “up” is always your looking direction. =
There are some special controls for the console: =
There are two core attributes of melee weapons: =
There are two types of light: Sunlight and artificial light. =
There is a large variety of settings to configure Minetest. Pretty much every aspect can be changed that way. =
There is a rule which sometimes makes attacks impossible: Players, animate objects and weapons belong to damage groups. A weapon only deals damage to those who share at least one damage group with it. So if you're using the wrong weapon, you might not deal any damage at all. =
There is a small set of core privileges which you'll find on every server, other privileges might be added by mods. =
There is also Cinematic Mode which can be toggled with [F8]. With Cinematic Mode enabled, the camera movements become more smooth. Some players don't like it, it is a matter of taste. =
There is also an input history. Minetest saves your previous console inputs which you can quickly access later: =
These are a few of the most important gameplay settings: =
These are the default controls: =
This is a list of commonly used terms in Minetest: =
This is a very brief introduction to the basic gameplay: =
This refers to the position where X\=5, Y\=45 and Z\=-12. The 3 letters are called “axes”: Y is for the height. X and Z are for the horizontal position. =
Throwing away: If you hold an item stack and click with it somewhere outside the menu, the item stack gets thrown away into the environment. =
To build your wielded block, point at a block in the world and right-click. If this is not possible because the pointed block has a special right-click action, hold down the sneak key before right-clicking. =
To complete the craft, take the result item from the output slot, which will consume items from the crafting grid and creates a new item. It is not possible to place items into the output slot. =
To craft something, you need one or more items, a crafting grid (C) and a crafting recipe. A crafting grid is like a normal inventory which can also be used for crafting. Items need to be put in a certain pattern into the crafting grid. Next to the crafting grid is an output slot (O). Here the result will appear when you placed items correctly. This is just a preview, not the actual item. Crafting grids can come in different sizes which limits the possible recipes you can craft. =
To issue a command, simply type it like a chat message or press Minetest's command key (default: [/]). All commands have to begin with “/”, for example “/mods”. The Minetest command key does the same as the chat key, except that the slash is already entered. =
To point something, it must be in the pointing range (also just called “range”) of your wielded item. There's a default range when you are not wielding anything. A pointed thing will be outlined or highlighted (depending on your settings). Pointing is not possible with the 3rd person front camera. =
To sneak, hold down the sneak key (default: [Shift]). When you release it, you stop sneaking. Careful: When you release the sneak key at a ledge, you might fall! =
To view your own privileges, issue the server command “/privs”. =
Tools =
Use the chat to communicate with other players. This requires you to have the “shout” privilege. =
Using the chat or server command key also opens the console, but it is smaller and will be closed after you sent a message. =
Weapons =
Web forums: <http://forums.minetest.net/> =
When nothing is wielded, players use their hand which may act as tool and weapon. The hand is capable of collecting dropped items by punching. =
When those criteria are met, the open space is filled with a new liquid source of the same type (image 3). =
While on a ladder, swimming in a liquid or fly mode is active =
While standing on solid ground: =
With [F10] you can open and close the console. The main use of the console is to show the chat log and enter chat messages or server commands. =
World interaction: =
You can change the camera mode by pressing [F7]. =
You can change the selected item with the mouse wheel or the number keys. =
You can send private messages: Say “/msg <player> <message>” in chat to send “<message>” which can only be seen by <player>. =
You can view your current position in the debug screen (open with [F5]). This is considered cheating in some games. =
You have your own inventory which is called your “player inventory”, you can open it with the inventory key (default: [I]). The first inventory slots are also used as slots in your hotbar. =
You may want to check out these online resources related to Minetest: =
“/help all” is a very important command: You get a list of all available commands on the server, a short explanation and the allowed parameters. This command is also important because the available commands often differ per server. =
“Pointing” means looking at something in range with the crosshair. Pointing is needed for interaction, like mining, punching, using, etc. Pointable things include blocks, dropped items, players, computer enemies and objects. =
